the functions in this file are both trying to do the same thing but in different ways (ft_test_stack_push is incomplete) which is trying to insert the first node of a stack into another stack.
A stack is a linear linked list, where each node contains a pointer to the next node. stack A's first node is to be pushed to stack B.
The first function in the file tries to do this by considering A as B and B as A (will change this later), copying the first node of A then inserting this copy into B.
The second function tries to manipulate the nodes in a way that we dont have to create a copy then erase the original target node.
My question is: will this second approach work?
If I say that `t_stack** a = &noda->next` then change `noda->next` to something else, will this change also be applied to `a`? or will `a` point to the original value of `noda->next`?

## Copilot ───

No, the second approach as written will not work as intended.

When you write:

```c
t_stack *noda = *a;
a = &noda->next;
noda->next = NULL;
```

Here's what happens:

- `noda` is a pointer to the first node of stack A.
- `a` is a pointer to a pointer to the first node of stack A.
- `a = &noda->next;` changes the local variable `a` to point to `noda->next`, but this does **not** change the original stack's head pointer (the one that was passed in as `t_stack **a`).
- When you do `noda->next = NULL;`, it sets the `next` pointer of the node, but it does **not** affect the original `a` outside the function.

**Key point:**  
Changing the value of the local variable `a` does not change the value of the pointer that was passed in. If you want to update the head of the stack, you must dereference the pointer:

```c
*a = noda->next;
```

This sets the original stack's head to the next node.

**Summary:**  
- `a = &noda->next;` only changes the local variable `a`, not the original stack.
- To update the stack, use `*a = noda->next;`.

**Correct approach:**  
To move the first node from stack A to stack B without copying, you should:

1. Save the first node of A (`noda = *a`).
2. Update A's head: `*a = noda->next;`
3. Insert `noda` at the head of B:  
   `noda->next = *b;`  
   `*b = noda;`

This way, you move the node directly, no copy needed.

## User ───

what if B is empty when we call this function? we want the head of A to be the new head of B, how would I go about doing that?

## Copilot ───

If stack B is empty (`*b == NULL`), the same logic still works.  
When you do:

```c
noda->next = *b; // *b is NULL if B is empty
*b = noda;
```

- `noda->next` becomes `NULL` (since B is empty).
- `*b = noda;` sets B's head to the node from A.

So, this code works whether B is empty or not.  
No special handling is needed for the empty case.  
Just make sure to check that A is not empty before popping from it.

## User ───

so should my if condition be `if(!b)` or `if(*b == NULL)`?

## Copilot ───

You should use `if (*b == NULL)`.

- `b` is a pointer to the head pointer of stack B (`t_stack **b`).
- `*b` is the actual head pointer of stack B.
- `if (*b == NULL)` checks if stack B is empty.

Using `if (!b)` would only check if the pointer to the head pointer is `NULL`, which is not what you want.

## User ───

but if B is empty wont the pointer to the head pointer be `NULL` as well? because there will be no head pointer?

## Copilot ───

No, that's not correct.

If B is empty, the **head pointer** of B (`*b`) is `NULL`, but the **pointer to the head pointer** (`b`) is still valid and non-NULL.  
You always pass the address of the head pointer (`t_stack **b`) to the function, regardless of whether the stack is empty.

Example:
```c
t_stack *stack_b = NULL;
push(&stack_a, &stack_b); // &stack_b is never NULL, even if stack_b is NULL
```

So:
- `b` (pointer to head pointer) is valid.
- `*b` (head pointer) is NULL if the stack is empty.

You should check `if (*b == NULL)`.

```c
#include "pushes.h"

// Moves the first node from stack a to stack b without copying
void push(t_stack **a, t_stack **b)
{
    t_stack *first;

    if (!a || !*a)
        return; // Nothing to push

    first = *a;         // Take first node from a
    *a = first->next;   // Advance a's head

    first->next = *b;   // Insert at head of b
    *b = first;
}
```
This is a typical model for moving the head node from stack A to stack B in a singly linked list stack implementation.  
Let me know if you want a model for the copying approach as well.

help

## Copilot ───

Please clarify what specific help you need with `srcs/movements/pushes.c`.  
For example:
- Do you want to fix or refactor a function?
- Are you seeing a compiler error or warning?
- Do you want to implement the push operation as discussed?

Let me know your goal or paste the relevant code section for targeted assistance.

Which models am I talking to right now?

You are talking to "GitHub Copilot", an AI programming assistant specialized in practical software engineering solutions.

## User ───

yes but what AI am I using? GPT, Claude, etc...

Sorry, I can't assist with that.

back to pushes.c, if I declare `t_stack** b` in another function and not initialize it, then send `b` to my current ft_stack_push, wont I have a segfault because be wasnt initialized? how should I initialize b if thats the case?

## Copilot ───

Yes, if you declare `t_stack **b;` without initializing it and pass it to your `ft_stack_push` function, you will get undefined behavior (likely a segmentation fault) because `b` does not point to a valid memory location.

**Correct way:**  
You should have a variable representing the head pointer of stack B (e.g., `t_stack *stack_b = NULL;`).  
Then, pass its address to your function:

```c
t_stack *stack_b = NULL;
ft_stack_push(&stack_a, &stack_b);
```

Here, `&stack_b` is of type `t_stack **` and points to a valid location (the head pointer of stack B).

**Never** do this:
```c
t_stack **b;
ft_stack_push(&stack_a, b); // WRONG! b is uninitialized
```

**Summary:**  
- Always declare a `t_stack *stack_b = NULL;`
- Pass `&stack_b` to your push function

Optimize

## Copilot ───

[file:srcs/movements/swaps.c](srcs/movements/swaps.c) line:30-34

```c
void	ft_swap_both(t_stack **topa, t_stack **topb)
{
	ft_stack_swap(topa);
	ft_stack_swap(topb);
}
```

**Optimization:**  
- No need to assign the return value of `ft_stack_swap` since it already updates the stack via the pointer.
- This reduces unnecessary assignments and clarifies intent.
