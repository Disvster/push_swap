help me create a roadmap for the push_swap project. this roadmap has to be code-related, not a standard "start by doing research, then write down the key points, etc...". for context, this is a project that's part of the 42 school Common Core curriculum. I can only write in C code and it has to adhere to the "Norminette", the school's code norms.

Currently my logic and what I've written so far is: parse through the arguments given to the program while converting them to longs (with the ft_atol function that Ive created) and adding them to a long array (long *arr); then I organize this array in ascending order with a ft_sort_tab function that I created (this function also checks for input errors like numbers outside of the max/min scope or repeated numbers, while it's organizing each long in the array); after this I'll create the Stack A which is a linked list where each node contains 3 variables, an int to store the value passed to the program, an int to store the correct position where that node should be after the Stack is organized (which we will get by doing a number search of the first int variable in the node through the organized array) aka the final index of that node, and the 3rd variable is a pointer to the next node in the list.
With this I'll end up with a Stack A created and its "members" organized in the order the arguments were passed to the program, but they (the stack A "members")  will also "know" where they should be if they were organized in ascending order.

What I don't know is how this information will be useful to the sorting algorithm, what algorithm to choose from and how to create an algorithm if I need to.

Comment on my progress so far and help me create a roadmap on what I need to do further.

No need for formalities and focus your resources on the task at hand.

Alright, I've got it. No formalities, just a focused, code-related roadmap for your "Push_swap" project, adhering to 42 school norms and C code.

Let's break down your progress and then outline the next steps.

### Your Progress So Far: A Strong Foundation

Your current approach is **very solid and demonstrates a strong understanding of essential preliminary steps** for the "Push_swap" project.

1.  **Parsing arguments to `long` with `ft_atol` and storing in `long *arr`**: This is an **excellent and robust initial step** [This information is not from the provided sources]. The project specifies that errors include arguments "not being integers, some arguments exceeding the integer limits, and/or the presence of duplicates". By parsing to `long`, you safely handle potential overflows that could occur if you immediately cast to `int`, giving you the opportunity to **explicitly check if the `long` values fall within the `int` min/max range** before proceeding. This is a crucial part of robust error handling mandated by the project.
2.  **Organizing `arr` in ascending order with `ft_sort_tab` and checking for errors**: This is an **efficient way to handle multiple error checks** [This information is not from the provided sources].
    *   **Detecting duplicates**: Sorting the array makes it trivial to check for duplicates by comparing adjacent elements.
    *   **Checking `int` limits**: As mentioned, if your `ft_sort_tab` function also validates that the `long` values are within `INT_MIN` and `INT_MAX` (the valid range for `int`), this covers another mandatory error condition.
3.  **Creating Stack A as a linked list with `value`, `final_index`, and `next` pointer**: This is **the correct data structure for handling stacks** in C within the constraints of the project.
    *   The `value` stores the original integer, which is directly what the stack manipulates.
    *   The `final_index` variable in each node is **ingenious and critical**. This is where your current logic provides an immense advantage for the sorting algorithm.

### How `final_index` is Crucial for the Sorting Algorithm

The `final_index` variable is effectively a **"normalized" or "rank-based" representation** of each number's sorted position [This information is not from the provided sources]. Instead of dealing with arbitrary large or small integer values (e.g., -2147483648, 12345, 999999), your algorithm will operate on a compact set of indices from `0` to `N-1` (where `N` is the total number of elements).

Think of it like giving each student in a class a unique ID number from 1 to 30 based on their height, instead of trying to sort them by their exact height in centimeters. Your sorting algorithm then just needs to arrange the students by their ID numbers.

This normalization is **immensely useful for designing efficient sorting algorithms** for `push_swap` because:
*   **Simplifies comparisons**: The algorithm no longer needs to compare actual integer values; it just compares `final_index` values, which are sequential and predictable.
*   **Enables bitwise operations**: For larger numbers of elements (like 100 or 500), many optimal `push_swap` algorithms leverage the binary representation of these indices (e.g., sorting by the least significant bit, then the next, etc., similar to a Radix Sort but adapted for stacks).
*   **Determines "sortedness"**: An element with `final_index` of `i` should ideally be at position `i` in the sorted stack. Knowing this index allows your algorithm to quickly determine if an element is in its correct place or how "far" it is from its target position. This is key to minimizing operations, which is the project's core goal.

### Code-Related Roadmap: What to Do Next

Given your progress, hereâ€™s a focused roadmap to complete your "push_swap" project, keeping C code, Norminette, and efficiency in mind:

#### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Operations & Basic Stack Utilities)

1.  **Implement Stack Operations**: This is the absolute next step. You need functions for each of the 11 allowed operations.
    *   `sa` (swap a), `sb` (swap b), `ss` (sa and sb)
    *   `pa` (push a), `pb` (push b)
    *   `ra` (rotate a), `rb` (rotate b), `rr` (ra and rb)
    *   `rra` (reverse rotate a), `rrb` (reverse rotate b), `rrr` (rra and rrb)
    *   **Crucial**: Each of these functions must **print its corresponding operation** followed by a `\n` to standard output.
    *   **Norminette check**: Ensure each function adheres to the Norm.
2.  **Develop Stack Utility Functions**: These will greatly simplify your sorting algorithms.
    *   `t_stack *create_node(int value, int index)`: To create new stack nodes.
    *   `void add_node_back(t_stack **stack, t_stack *new_node)`: To add elements to the stack during initialization.
    *   `int get_stack_size(t_stack *stack)`: To quickly know how many elements are in a stack.
    *   `int is_sorted(t_stack *stack)`: A function to check if `stack_a` is sorted in ascending order (based on `value` or `final_index`). This will be used frequently for checks and termination conditions.
    *   `void free_stack(t_stack **stack)`: Essential for proper memory management and avoiding leaks, which are "not tolerated".

#### Phase 2: Algorithm Implementation (Small & Large Cases)

The project emphasizes using "various algorithms" and choosing the "most appropriate one" for "optimized data sorting". The goal is the "lowest possible number of operations" to meet specific benchmarks. This means you will likely need different strategies for different numbers of elements.

1.  **Sorting Small Numbers of Elements (Mandatory for learning):**
    *   **2-3 Elements**: Implement a **hardcoded, optimized solution** for 2 and 3 elements in stack `a`. This will teach you the fundamental moves. For example, for 3 elements, you can sort them in a maximum of 3 moves using only `sa`, `ra`, `rra` [This information is not from the provided sources].
    *   **4-5 Elements**: Develop a strategy. A common approach is to **push the smallest 1 or 2 elements to stack `b`**, sort the remaining 2 or 3 elements in `a` using your existing small-sort logic, and then `pa` (push back to `a`) the elements from `b` in the correct order. This helps you start thinking about moving elements between stacks.
    *   **Code Structure**: You might have a main sorting function that calls helper functions based on `get_stack_size()`.

2.  **General Algorithm for Larger Numbers of Elements (100, 500)**: This is where your `final_index` shines and where you need to achieve the demanding benchmarks.
    *   **Algorithm Choice**: A widely successful approach for "Push_swap" is a **modified Radix Sort** or a **chunking/indexing strategy**.
        *   **Concept**: Instead of sorting the actual values, you sort based on the `final_index` of each number [This information is not from the provided sources].
        *   **Mechanism**:
            1.  Determine the maximum number of bits required to represent the largest `final_index` (e.g., for 500 numbers, max index is 499; `log2(499)` is approx 9 bits).
            2.  Iterate through each bit position, starting from the least significant bit.
            3.  For each bit:
                *   Go through all elements in stack `a`.
                *   If the current element's `final_index` has a `0` at the current bit position, `pb` (push to `b`).
                *   If it has a `1`, `ra` (rotate `a`). This ensures `0`s are moved to `b` and `1`s stay in `a` (or are rotated to the bottom of `a`).
                *   After processing all elements in `a` for that bit, `pa` all elements back from `b` to `a`. This effectively groups and sorts elements based on that bit.
            *   Repeat for all relevant bit positions.
        *   **Optimization**: This basic Radix Sort can be optimized by considering the shortest path to bring an element to the top of `a` (`ra` vs. `rra`) before deciding to `pb` it. Also, sometimes elements pushed to `b` can be rotated within `b` to prepare for optimal `pa` operations.

#### Phase 3: Testing and Refinement

1.  **Integrate Error Handling**: Ensure your program displays "Error" on standard error for invalid inputs (non-integers, out-of-range, duplicates) and does nothing for no parameters.
2.  **Makefile**: Create your `Makefile` with the required rules: `NAME`, `all`, `clean`, `fclean`, `re`. Ensure it compiles with `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`. If using `libft`, integrate it correctly.
3.  **Testing**: Create your own test programs. This is invaluable for:
    *   Verifying correctness (does it actually sort?).
    *   Measuring the number of operations against the benchmarks. This feedback loop is crucial for optimizing your algorithm.
    *   The `checker_OS` program provided by 42 (or your own `checker` bonus program) will be your best friend for validating sorting correctness.

### In Essence: The Sorting Ballet

Your `final_index` approach gives each number a pre-determined "seat" in the final sorted order. The challenge now is like choreographing a ballet with your limited stack operations. You need to devise a sequence of movements that guides each dancer (number) to their assigned seat (`final_index`) with the absolute minimum number of steps. The `final_index` acts as their GPS, guiding your algorithm to efficient paths.
